### Hi there welcome to my food blogðŸ‘‹

<h5>I like cooking for people. Here are some things I've made recently (while also practicing my floundering Markdown abilities):</h5>

<ul>
  <li>This is some <b>ramen</b> I made. Unfortunately I bought creamed corn instead of corn, so that explains the congealed mess at the top.</li>

  <li>This is <b>mazesoba</b>, a dry ramen with many delicious toppings!</li>

  <li>You already know that I made a Christmas feast</li>

  <li>A couple weeks ago, I slowcooked some carnitas and made my own chicken noodle soup from scratch!</li>

</ul>

<h5>I also enjoy planning and executing dinner parties. Here are a couple:</h5>
