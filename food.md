### Hi there welcome to my food blogðŸ‘‹

I like cooking for people. Here are some things I've made recently (while also practicing my floundering Markdown abilities):
<ul>
  <li>This is some ramen I made. Unfortunately I bought creamed corn instead of corn, so that explains the congealed mess at the top.</li>
    <br><img src="ramen.jpg" width="200"></br>

  <li>This is <b>mazesoba</b>, a dry ramen with many toppings!</li>

</ul>
